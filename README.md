# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
To build a dynamic webpage using JavaScript, a front-end development language also used for Google search or shopping in Amazon to name a few examples. JavaScript lets us build an interactive webpage that allows to loop through the data, display, build table and customized dashboard. Also, we use html, bootstrap and css and chrome dev tools style that is visually appealing and live.   

Link to UFO Sightings webpage
The deployed webpage is accessible at file:///C:/Users/esbus/Desktop/Class/UFOs/index.html
Index page
This is the initial page. The user can re-initialize the page by clicking on the navbar at the top.
Filtering by event date
The user enters the desired date, the change is detected, and the table is updated accordingly.
## Summary 
### Drawback:  
1.	There is no indication as to how many fields you need to complete enough to get a single result.  
2.	The field is case sensitive 
3.	The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.
### Recommendations for further development:
Although this is a good practice for students on how to build an interactive dashboard, clearly it needs improvement
*	All it takes is to fill in one of the category to get a result and the more you provide more information in the search the better to narrow down your search to a specific result. 
*	Either a dropdown or an auto fill should be added to enhance and provide a better experience to the user 
*	The dashboard looks good, but it can be better. We can add more functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.
